# Student Evaluation Form

## Overview

The Student Evaluation Form is a Python-based application designed to facilitate quizzes and coding exercises for students. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to engage with the application interactively. The application presents a series of quiz questions and evaluates user responses, providing feedback based on their performance. Additionally, it offers a jumbled coding exercise to challenge users' problem-solving skills.

## Features

- **Quiz Section:** 
  - Presents 5 multiple-choice questions with randomly selected questions from a predefined JSON dataset.
  - Users select answers using radio buttons.
  - Feedback is provided based on the score achieved.

- **Jumbled Code Section:**
  - Allows users to solve coding problems presented in a jumbled format.
  - Users can submit their solution, which is compared against a reference to determine accuracy.

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Displays custom images and messages based on user performance.
  - Offers a scoring mechanic that awards points for correct answers.

## Requirements

To run the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)
- Any additional libraries/packages specified in the JSON data file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files directly.
2. Ensure you have the `data.json` file in the same directory as your script. The JSON file should contain a format with questions and possible answers.
3. Place any required image files (`great.png`, `ok.png`, `bad.png`, `std1.png`, `Start3.png`) in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the application using the command line:

   ```bash
   python student_evaluation_form.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to take the quiz or solve the jumbled code.

## Usage

- Start the application, and you will see options to take the quiz or solve jumbled code.
- Click on the relevant button to proceed.
- For the quiz, select your answer for each question and wait for the results.
- In the jumbled code section, you will input your solution and receive feedback on your accuracy.
